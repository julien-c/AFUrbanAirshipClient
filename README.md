# AFUrbanAirshipClient
**An API Client for Registering and Unregistering Devices with Urban Airship**

[Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com) is a popular mobile service provider of push notifications, in-app purchases, and Newsstand publications. Although they [provide a static library](http://urbanairship.com/resources/), it includes a lot of things that most people don't need (weighing in at an _astounding_ 12MB), and is [not the easiest thing in the world to use](https://docs.urbanairship.com/ios-lib/index.html).

`AFUrbanAirshipClient` is a small, simple client to the Urban Airship API that uses [AFNetworking](https://github.com/afnetworking/afnetworking) to perform the essential tasks of registering and unregistering devices for push notifications.

## Usage

### AppDelegate.m

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [application registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge];

    ...
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application
didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
{
    AFUrbanAirshipClient *client = [[AFUrbanAirshipClient alloc] initWithApplicationKey:kUrbanAirshipApplicationKey applicationSecret:kUrbanAirshipApplicationSecret];
    [client registerDeviceToken:deviceToken withAlias:nil success:^(id responseObject) {
        NSLog(@"Success: %@", responseObject);
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
    }];
}
```

### Default Values

If `-registerDeviceToken:withAlias:badge:tags:timezone:quietTimeStart:quietTimeEnd:success:failure:` scares you as much as it does me, you'll probably want to stick with `-registerDeviceToken:withAlias:success:failure:`, which provides the following default values:

- `tags`:
    - Application Bundle Version _(e.g. v1.0)_
    - Operating System _(e.g. iOS 6.0)_
    - Current Locale Identifier _(e.g. en_US)_
    - Device Model _(e.g. iPhone)_
- `tz`: The current timezone
- `badge`: `0`
- `quiettime`: `nil`

> If you're the enterprising type, or just happen to have the registration payload ready to go, you can always use `-registerDeviceToken:withPayload:success:failure:`.
